# Sprint 1: TypeScript CSV

### Task C: Proposing Enhancement

- #### Step 3: use an LLM to help expand your perspective.

    Include a list of the top 4 enhancements or edge cases you think are most valuable to explore in the next week’s sprint. Label them clearly by category (extensibility vs. functionality), and include whether they came from you, the LLM, or both. Describe these using the User Story format—see below for a definition. 

    Include your notes from above: what were your initial ideas, what did the LLM suggest, and how did the results differ by prompt? What resonated with you, and what didn’t? (3-5 sentences.)
